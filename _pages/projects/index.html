fooplot(Javascript): A simple app for KaiOS to graph mathematical functions Talking bot for KaiOS(Vanilla Javascript): A talking(not chatting) bot toy app for KaiOS VM-IRC(Javascript, JQuery): A simple and minimal IRC client for KaiOS with limited functionality simplequran: A very simple app to read the Holy Quran drawlogo86(x86 Assembly): This program displays a 16x16 sprite(possibly your logo!) when you boot your storage. KaiScr(Python): Two small programs written in Python to record screen of a KaiOS 2.x device as well as watching a live stream of it msim(Common Lisp): A small program written in Common Lisp to simulate a simple Mafia/Werewolf game with presence of fool. Then it finds out how much of a winning chance do each of the teams and the fool have got. Maintained deltachat-loginbot(Rust, Axum): Written with Rust and axum, it covers enough of OAuth2 specification so that users of a Discourse instance can login with their DeltaChat. stack-gp-test(Rust): An example program, written in Rust, which solves a simple Symbolic Regression problem using Stack based Genetic Programming. Includes some text about Genetic Programming, Stack based Genetic Programming and the Symbolic Regression problem in general. wakegp(Rust, rayon, cranelift): Exploiting Linear Genetic Programming to do wake word detection using binary classification. Vitae(Javascript, Hugo): This is theme of this blog. When Benedikt gave up on maintaining the theme, I took over. Not maintained KaiUIng(SASS, SCSS, CSS, InfernoJS, Typescript): A UI library for KaiOS. With Inferno bindings. chooj(Typescript, InfernoJS, KaiOS): A Matrix client for KaiOS. fobil(Common Lisp): A simple static blog generator mtbotter(C++): A library to create Minetest bots. I don’t remember anything about it. If I wanted Minetest bots again, I would replicate the protocol implementation in Rust. BHA(Python): Bash History Analyzer PotatoEgg(Cherrypy, Python, Vanilla Javascript): A simple file manager but web based chooj’s push-gateway(Python, Flask): A Matrix client needs a push gateway server to deliever push notifications. The current version is more a prototype. For real world usage, I would change it or even rewrite it in Rust. ctf-notify(Flask, Python, React, Javascript): A small web application to get current status of the Minetest CTF server as well as getting notification when the desired setup(map/mode/online players) is being played.
