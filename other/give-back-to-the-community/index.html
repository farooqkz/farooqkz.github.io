In FOSS world, you usually don’t pay for the software you are using. When we say you don’t pay, this doesn’t mean only money.

When we say you don&rsquo;t pay, this doesn&rsquo;t mean only money. It also means you don&rsquo;t sell your data to companies and then governments in exchange for service or software. Nor you see ads in FOSS most of the time, if not always. As a matter of fact, people or precisely programmers, develop these softwares in their free time as a hobby. Of course not all open source softwares work like this but most of them do. There is no direct benefit for the developers of Minetest for developing Minetest.</p><p>Since I was about 9th grade, years ago, I&rsquo;ve been playing CTF game on its server which back then was hosted and started by <a href=https://rubenwardy.com/ target=_blank>rubenwardy</a> who is also a core developer of Minetest. The game in its early days was very basic but fun. The game is still on with a variety of new features. I am still playing the game on the server which is now hosted by LanderVargan(formerly LoneWolf).</p><p>Recently, I thought of something: I am playing this game for a very long time and having fun with it. And for all players who play it, there are about just a handful who work on its development. Because of very low value of my local currency, Rial. I cannot donate and help with hosting but I am a programmer and can work on the development. Actually I think it is my responsibility to work on it not just because I have the skill but also because I&rsquo;ve got the time to spend.</p><p>For anyone reading my article I suggest you &ldquo;give back&rdquo; to the community who build a software which you use. If you have money, donate some. Preferably, on a regular basis. Even small amounts will help. And even if it doesn&rsquo;t, it will bring warm feelings to the heart of developers so that they can see they&rsquo;re not alone.</p><p>If you&rsquo;ve got the time, you can help with development, testing, documenting or helping other people with their problems with the software.</p><p>If you&rsquo;ve got no time nor money, still you can do something: Simply send a &ldquo;Thank you&rdquo; message to the developer(s). State in your email what you like about their software and that it has been useful for you. And possibly write about things like UI/UX which you dislike.</p><p>As a summary, open source community driven softwares get what they need from their communities and we, are those who form their community.</p><script type=text/javascript src=https://latest.cactus.chat/cactus.js></script><link rel=stylesheet href=https://latest.cactus.chat/style.css type=text/css><div id=comment-section></div><script>window.onload=()=>initComments({node:document.getElementById("comment-section"),defaultHomeserverUrl:"https://matrix.cactus.chat:8448",serverName:"cactus.chat",siteName:"far.chickenkiller.com",commentSectionId:"give-back-to-the-community.md"})</script></div></div></article></div></main><footer>(C) Some rights are reserved under CC-BY-SA 4.0 for Farooq Karimi Zadeh</footer><script src=/js/dark-mode.js></script></body></html>
