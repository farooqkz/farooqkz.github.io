The reason I was considering myself an “idiot” was simply because my knowledge was very limited. And my learning process was super slow.

Actually, I believe a slow but long term and constant is much better than a super fast progress which sometimes comes and most of the time is absent.

You need to have constant and slow steps. You don&rsquo;t need to push yourself too hard, just have small daily exercises and try to not miss a day. As a progammer, I tend to code or think about problems almost everyday. Even when I am with family, I sometimes think to the problems. Not just technical ones but also philosophical ones.</p><p>If you want to master something, and you are a teenager around 15 or so now, it is a good time to start. But don&rsquo;t expect to understand everything instantly. It is a fact that some concepts in science, need some effort and time to deeply understand them. And usually you can&rsquo;t do it in half the time, your mind really needs to adapt itself to the new situation.</p><h3 id=a-real-world-example>A real world example</h3><p>A friend of mine, <a href=https://github.com/b-simjoo target=_blank>Behnam Simjoo</a>, is TA of a fundemental CS course in <a href=https://hormozgan.ac.ir target=_blank>Hormozgan University</a>. He and I been doing programming(and not Computer Science) for long since school. He always says those without programming background can&rsquo;t have their mind adapted in just one semester(3-4 months) to think like a programmer. And the University is quite on the wrong track in asking them to pass this course in one semester. Needless to say that the way a considerable number of students in this country, perhaps a majority of them, are not even near the right track in choosing their academic branch which is mandatory from highschool.</p><script type=text/javascript src=/cactus.js></script><link rel=stylesheet href=/style.css type=text/css><div id=comment-section></div><script>window.onload=()=>initComments({node:document.getElementById("comment-section"),defaultHomeserverUrl:"https://matrix.cactus.chat:8448",serverName:"cactus.chat",siteName:"far.chickenkiller.com",commentSectionId:"you-are-not-dumb.md"})</script></div></div></article></div></main><footer>(C) Some rights are reserved under CC-BY-SA 4.0 for Farooq Karimi Zadeh</footer><script src=/js/dark-mode.js></script></body></html>
