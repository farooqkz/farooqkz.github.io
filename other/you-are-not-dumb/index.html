They call themselves &ldquo;dumb&rdquo;, &ldquo;idiot&rdquo; and such these words. They think they are not worthy. To be honest, I had similar behaviors when I was a teenager. And now I know I was wrong.</p><p>The reason I was considering myself an &ldquo;idiot&rdquo; was simply because my knowledge was very limited. And my learning process was super slow. But after years, I have come to this understanding that a slow but constant learning rate can have great effects after a few years. Actually, I believe a slow but long term and constant is much better than a super fast progress which sometimes comes and most of the time is absent. There is a proverb for this in Persian: The true traveller is the one who goes constantly slow rather than the one who doesn&rsquo;t walk the way but sometimes does a quick run.</p><p>The problem&rsquo;s that these teenagers believe they are idiots because they can&rsquo;t become the Master of one thing(for example some branch of Math or some programming language or any branch of science) in just a 24/7 effort.</p><p>If you want to master something, you don&rsquo;t need to move fast. You need to have constant and slow steps. You don&rsquo;t need to push yourself too hard, just have small daily exercises and try to not miss a day. As a progammer, I tend to code or think about problems almost everyday. Even when I am with family, I sometimes think to the problems. Not just technical ones but also philosophical ones.</p><p>If you want to master something, and you are a teenager around 15 or so now, it is a good time to start. But don&rsquo;t expect to understand everything instantly. It is a fact that some concepts in science, need some effort and time to deeply understand them. And usually you can&rsquo;t do it in half the time, your mind really needs to adapt itself to the new situation.</p><h3 id=a-real-world-example>A real world example</h3><p>A friend of mine, <a href=https://github.com/b-simjoo target=_blank>Behnam Simjoo</a>, is TA of a fundemental CS course in <a href=https://hormozgan.ac.ir target=_blank>Hormozgan University</a>. He and I been doing programming(and not Computer Science) for long since school. He always says those without programming background can&rsquo;t have their mind adapted in just one semester(3-4 months) to think like a programmer. And the University is quite on the wrong track in asking them to pass this course in one semester. Needless to say that the way a considerable number of students in this country, perhaps a majority of them, are not even near the right track in choosing their academic branch which is mandatory from highschool.</p><script type=text/javascript src=https://latest.cactus.chat/cactus.js></script>
