once upon a time
there was Python my prime
everything was simple
slow and grimple
Kai came later
Front came after
it was to blossum
jump up to the moon
but not yet, no
there was something I needed to know
It was safe, it was fast
It was a new one, it was rust
no more callic or malloc
no free, no realloc
play all over the threads
asynchorous and needles
I will talk and walk
will call and into the pitfall
is this a game or real life
oh wait somebody has a knife
wants he my heart or my phone?
or my wallet or my jacket?
someone turn me on and off
a small reboot and I'm done
no more nonsense no more poem
or far or the killer of da chicken

-- This was generated by Farooq IXX machine. Somebody had to turn him off because he was generating non-sense in the end as admitted by himself in the poem.
