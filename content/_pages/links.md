These are the interesting folks who I would like to mention them here with a link:

- [lumidify's gopherhole](gopher://lumidify.org): He is almost at the same age as me. He doesn't like bloated stuff like the Web and many softwares in today's world. Last time I was with contact with him, he was creating a text editor with C.
 - [Luxferre's weblog](https://chronovir.us/): Another hacker but much older than me. Dislikes bloated stuff and the founder of BananaHackers community.
 - [John David Deubl(strukturart)](https://strukturart.com): An Artist, Analogue photographer, poet and hardworking programmer. I always admired his constant distraction-free hardwork in my heart.
 - [Affe Null](https://git.abscue.de/affe_null): This hacker have done significant work and is a BananaHacker council member. You might know about [the port of Debian to 8110](https://git.abscue.de/bananian/bananian), [the shell for the same phone](https://git.abscue.de/obp/bananui/bananui) and [his toolbox for hacking Nokia 2780 flip](https://git.abscue.de/affe_null/weeknd-toolbox).
 - [Muhammad Saleh Kamyab](https://framagit.org/mskf1383): This boy is another young programmer. He has also interests in literature which is quite rare among programmers!
