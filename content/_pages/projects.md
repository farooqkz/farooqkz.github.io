## Lead developer

These are the projects which I lead.
### One time
These are the one time projects which I wasn't supposed to maintain them in the long term.
 
 - [fooplot](https://notabug.org/bananaphone/fooplot)(Javascript): A simple app for KaiOS to graph mathematical functions
 -  [Talking bot for KaiOS](https://notabug.org/bananaphone/talkingbot)(Vanilla Javascript): A talking(not chatting) bot toy app for KaiOS
 - [VM-IRC](https://notabug.org/bananaphone/vm-irc)(Javascript, JQuery): A simple and minimal IRC client for KaiOS with limited functionality
 -  [simplequran](https://notabug.org/bananaphone/simplequran): A very simple app to read the Holy Quran
 -  [drawlogo86](https://notabug.org/farooqkz/drawlogo86)(x86 Assembly): This program displays a 16x16 sprite(possibly your logo!) when you boot your storage.
 - [KaiScr](https://notabug.org/farooqkz/KaiScr)(Python): Two small programs written in Python to record screen of a KaiOS 2.x device as well as watching a live stream of it
 - [msim](https://codeberg.org/farooqkz/msim)(Common Lisp): A small program written in Common Lisp to simulate a simple Mafia/Werewolf game with presence of fool. Then it finds out how much of a winning chance do each of the teams and the fool have got.
### Maintained

 - [deltachat-loginbot](https://github.com/deltachat-bot/deltachat-loginbot)(Rust, Axum): Written with [Rust](https://rust-lang.org) and [axum](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum), it covers enough of [OAuth2](https://oauth.net) specification so that users of a [Discourse](https://discourse.org) instance can login with their [DeltaChat](https://delta.chat).
 - [stack-gp-test](https://github.com/farooqkz/stack-gp-test)(Rust): An example program, written in Rust, which solves a simple Symbolic Regression problem using Stack based Genetic Programming. Includes some text about Genetic Programming, Stack based Genetic Programming and the Symbolic Regression problem in general.
 - [wakegp](https://codeberg.org/farooqkz/wakegp)(Rust, rayon, cranelift): Exploiting [Linear Genetic Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_genetic_programming) to do wake word detection using [binary classification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_classification).
 - [Vitae](https://codeberg.org/farooqkz/hugo-vitae)(Javascript, Hugo): This is theme of this blog. When Benedikt gave up on maintaining the theme, I took over.
### Not maintained
 - [KaiUIng](https://github.com/farooqkz/KaiUIng)(SASS, SCSS, CSS, InfernoJS, Typescript): A UI library for KaiOS. With [Inferno](https://infernojs.org) bindings.
 - [chooj](https://github.com/farooqkz/chooj)(Typescript, InfernoJS, KaiOS): A [Matrix](https://matrix.org) client for [KaiOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KaiOS).
 - [fobil](https://notabug.org/farooqkz/fobil)(Common Lisp): A simple static blog generator
 - [mtbotter](https://notabug.org/farooqkz/mtbotter)(C++): A library to create [Minetest](https://minetest.net) bots. I don't remember anything about it. If I wanted Minetest bots again, I would replicate the protocol implementation in Rust.
 - [BHA](https://notabug.org/farooqkz/BHA)(Python): Bash History Analyzer
 - [PotatoEgg](https://notabug.org/farooqkz/PotatoEgg)(Cherrypy, Python, Vanilla Javascript): A simple file manager but web based
 - [chooj's push-gateway](https://github.com/farooqkz/chooj-pushgateway)(Python, Flask): A Matrix client needs a push gateway server to deliever push notifications. The current version is more a prototype. For real world usage, I would change it or even rewrite it in Rust.
  - [ctf-notify](https://github.com/farooqkz/ctf-notify)(Flask, Python, React, Javascript): A small web application to get current status of [the Minetest CTF server](https://ctf.rubenwardy.com) as well as getting notification when the desired setup(map/mode/online players) is being played.
## Major contributor

These are the projects which I have contributed significant amount of code to them.
### Active
- [message-parser](https://github.com/deltachat/message-parser)(Rust, nom): This is utilized to parse different portions of a text message in DeltaChat Desktop. We hope that in future, it could be utilized in other DeltaChat apps as well. I'm thinking I could even one day use it in chooj.
- [Minetest Capture the Flag](https://github.com/MT-CTF)(Lua, Minetest/Luanti): I think my first contribution was somewhere around 2020-2021. Not so sure. Also read [this post of mine](/computer/evolution-of-minetest-ctf-game-over-years/) regarding the history of the game, as well as [this post from rubenwardy on his blog](https://blog.rubenwardy.com/2023/08/16/minetest-ctf-is-10/).
### Past contributor
 - [DeltaChat Desktop](https://github.com/deltachat/deltachat-desktop)(Electron, Tauri, Typescript, React, SCSS, SASS): See [DeltaChat](https://delta.chat). Utilizes a backend such as Electron or Tauri and a frontend written using React and Javascript.
