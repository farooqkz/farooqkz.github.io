### The name

My fullname is Farooq Karimi Zadeh Shaquii. Farooq is my first name and that's the name most people call me with it. And also what I prefer people to call me with it. Karimi Zadeh is my last name. And finally, Shaquii is the suffix and is name of my Father's town/homeland.

### Technical and Academic interests

I've been programming since I was about 12 years old. With [Game Maker 8.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GameMaker) and not with code, I was creating silly 2D games. Later, I started learning CSharp and voila `MessageBox.Show("Me is virus!");` :) and yeah don't forget the semicolon...

After that and creating a bunch of silly stuff, this time apps, with Visual Studio, sometime in 2015 I transferred with my baggage to Ubuntu. No CSharp there so I started learning Python, version 3. I continued writing silly CLI stuff till I discovered web and started creating web applications with CherryPy. Later in around 2020, I replaced CherryPy with Flask because it had a bigger community.

In 2022, I learned about Genetic Algorithms and had started Rust in about the same time to have a compiled language in my toolbox along other things. I was thinking, what if we evolve math formulas with this Evolutionary heuristic instead of just strings? After some research, I found Genetic Programming and Symbolic Regression. So till now I'm stuck with Rust and Evolutionary Algorithms. I needed a language with high performance and Python wasn't it. I also wanted the language to be suitable for usage in embedded industry so that I won't have to learn another one solely for that purpose. The answer for me till now is Rust.

I am also interested in Circuits. Actually my hobby before I turned into the dark side of the Source was circuits. But at that time when I was about 12 years old or younger, I could not design my own circuits and just assembling the circuits others had designed wasn't fun.

Last but not the least, Mathematics and combinatorics are also very interesting for me. However, I don't spend much time with these very old friends of mine.

### Languages

I can fully use Persian, Bandari and English. Perhaps Bandari should not be counted as another language. It is spoken by native people of my city, the islands in the south of my city and many villages around my city. Other cities in the same province have a bit different versions of the same language. Language of some people outside the province but close to it are also very similar and distinguished from the language of other people of that provinces.

I can also understand Arabic. Not good enough to talk in Arabic but good enough to understand a big portion of texts especially if they are old.

Other than these 3(or 4), I am learning German and I've found its old words similar to English and Persian.

### Projects

Now here we get to the interesting part :)

These are maintained:

 - [chooj](https://github.com/farooqkz/chooj): A [Matrix](https://matrix.org) client for [KaiOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KaiOS).
 - [ctf-notify](https://github.com/farooqkz/ctf-notify): A small web application to get current status of [the Minetest CTF server](https://ctf.rubenwardy.com) as well as getting notification when the desired setup(map/mode/online players) is being played.
 - [KaiUIng](https://github.com/farooqkz/KaiUIng): A UI library for KaiOS. With [Inferno](https://infernojs.org) bindings.
 - [stack-gp-test](https://github.com/farooqkz/stack-gp-test): An example program, written in Rust, which solves a simple Symbolic Regression problem using Stack based Genetic Programming. Includes some text about Genetic Programming, Stack based Genetic Programming and the Symbolic Regression problem in general.
 - [KaiScr](https://notabug.org/farooqkz/KaiScr): Two small programs written in Python to record screen of a KaiOS device as well as watching a live stream of it.

These aren't actively maintained anymore:

 - [Talking bot for KaiOS](https://notabug.org/bananaphone/talkingbot): A talking(not chatting) bot toy app for KaiOS.
 - [VM-IRC](https://notabug.org/bananaphone/vm-irc): A simple and minimal IRC client for KaiOS.
 - [fooplot](https://notabug.org/bananaphone/fooplot): A simple app for KaiOS to graph mathematical functions
 - [simplequran](https://notabug.org/bananaphone/simplequran): A very simple app to read the Holy Quran.
 - [fobil](https://notabug.org/farooqkz/fobil): A simple static blogger
 - [drawlogo86](https://notabug.org/farooqkz/drawlogo86): This program displays a 16x16 sprite(possibly your logo!) when you boot your storage.
 - [mtbotter](https://notabug.org/farooqkz/mtbotter): A library to create [Minetest](https://minetest.net) bots. I don't remember anything about it. If I wanted Minetest bots again, I would replicate the protocol implementation in Rust.
 - [BHA](https://notabug.org/farooqkz/BHA): Bash History Analyzer
 - [PotatoEgg](https://notabug.org/farooqkz/PotatoEgg): A simple file manager but web based

### Friends' websites

Author(s) of these people are not necessary my real life friends. Many of them, I have never seen or talk with them and we were communicating with IM apps. Nevertheless, I would like to include a link to their website because I think they have content useful and interesting. Among these, many of these "hacker friends" don't like the bloated web and prefer to have a gopherhole.

 - [lumidify's gopherhole](gopher://lumidify.org): He is almost at the same age as me. He doesn't like bloated stuff like the Web and many softwares in today's world. Last time I was with contact with him, he was creating a text editor with C.
 - [Luxferre's weblog](https://chronovir.us/): Another hacker but much older than me. Dislikes bloated stuff and the founder of BananaHackers community.
 - [Simon Laux's Github](https://github.com/simon-laux): He doesn't have a website which I am aware of, yet. Before he tells me he is almost the same age as me, I was expecting him to be around 30 like Luxferre because he seems really wise and very skillful.
 - [Behnam Simjoo's Github](https://github.com/b-simjoo/): Behnam has been a close friend of mine for years. Our technical interests can be very different as well as how we approach the problems. He also has something which I believe the rest of this list don't: He is both a good web developer and a good web designer. To be honest, I don't have talent for art like he does. We write in https://pcworms.ir together but that's Persian and he hasn't got an English website, yet.
 - [Cyan's Github](https://github.com/cyan-2048): This youth is a very hardworking and talented programmer. Doesn't have a website, yet.
 - [John David Deubl(strukturart)](https://strukturart.com): An Artist, Analogue photographer, poet and hardworking programmer. I always admired his constant distraction-free hardwork in my heart.
