### The name

My full name is Farooq Karimi Zadeh Shaquii. Farooq is my first name and that's what I prefer people to call me with. Karimi Zadeh is my last name. And finally, Shaquii is the suffix and is the name of my Father's town/homeland.

#### The last name
From a certain point of view, "X Zadeh" last names in Persian are like "XSon" in English. "X Zadeh" means we are descendants of "X". In my childhood, when we were in the cemetery of our town, I tried finding my late grandfather's grave, then his father, his grandfather and so on. Finally I found that one of our forefathers was named "Karim". I couldn't find Karim's grave.
