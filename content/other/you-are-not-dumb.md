It is common among some teenagers from 15 to 17 or so. They call themselves "dumb", "idiot" and such these words. They think they are not worthy. To be honest, I had similar behaviors in when I was a teenageer. And now I understand I was wrong.

The reason I was considering myself an "idiot" was simply because my knowledge was very limited. And my learning process was super slow. But after years, I have come to this understanding that a slow but constant learning rate can have great effects after a few years. The problem's that these teenagers believe they are idiots because they can't become the Master of one thing(for example some branch of Math or some programming language or any branch of science) in just a week of 24/7 effort.

If you want to master something, you don't need to move fast. You need to have constant and slow steps. You don't need to push yourself too hard, just have small daily exercises and try to not miss a day. As a progammer, I tend to code or think about problems almost everyday. Even when I am with family, I sometimes think to the problems. Not just technical ones but also philosophical ones.

If you want to master something, and you are a teenager around 15 or so now, it is a good time to start. But don't expect to understand everything instantly. It is a fact that some concepts in science, need some effort and time to well-understand them. And usually you can't do it in half the time, your mind really needs to adapt itself to the new situation.

A friend of mine, [Behnam Simjoo](https://github.com/b-simjoo), is TA of a fundemental CS course in [Hormozgan University](https://hormozgan.ac.ir). He always says those without programming background can't have their mind adapted in just one semester(3-4 months) to think like a programmer. And the University is quite on the wrong track in asking them to pass this course in one semester. Needless to say that the way most students choose their academic branch in Iran is not even near the right track.
