A planet with just one big ocean and two continents on the east and the west polars. He wakes up. He is having another dream. First time Lance had one of these dreams, it was murder of his mother, the only one he had in life, which soon after happened. And the last time before this dream brought him a sword. His sword is rather interesting and very different. And he knew if the people realize this thing exists, they would try to replicate or steal it and then use it for unlawful purposes, mostly killing. It could become chaos and one with such a weapon could have much power, even more than the entire police force and their fancy weapons. That's why Lance had used his sword just once when his life was at stake.

The last time he had such dreams, or more precisely, visions, it was a mission to construct a sword, one which currently he has in possess. Someone, or something was talking to him in his sleep so that he could realize something about the future or to give him a mission.

This time, Lance was uncertain if this dream is a mission for him or the entity is trying to tell him, maybe warn him, about the future. If he knew his first dream could become real soon after, perhaps his mother was still alive. But he could only plan for future, not for the past.

"If I could know more about this planet, maybe I could realize if Ashla wants a mission from me or if it's something else" he said to himself. Ashla was the name he had chosen for the entity talking to him in his sleeps. Lance thinks Ashla is also the same entity giving him the powers and skills. Sometimes he was wondering if there was someone else on the planet or maybe on the other planets with the same abilities and sensibilites as he has.

Unfortunately, his home didn't have a connection to the planet's network. Obviously the government had no incentive to provide a network connection to a village with only 9 residents who are all eldery except him. Elderies hadn't got a terminal let alone usage of a network connection.

He always wished he had a terminal to access the one of the central computers in the nearby city. Money, however, was a big problem for a worker like him.

After some thinking, he decided to use one of those shared terminals in the cafe in the city center. The government was providing free shared access terminals, 60 hours a month for all citizens. From there, he could access the galaxy map and find out about the planet in his vision.

He took his bike to have a trip to the city. As Lance was distancing from the village, he saw someone on the road side asking for help. It seemed a poor woman in trouble. He always believed in helping people and therefore he made a stop to see if he could be of any assist to her.

Once he stopped and went off the bike, the woman came to him crying "Thank you! Thank you so much. I've tried to get help here but there are few transports passing and none of them stop.". "What's the problem, ma'am? Do you need some help?" he said. "Yeah sure" the woman said while she was taking something from her bag "Your wallet and bike could worth a few hunders" she smiled while pointing her gun towards him.

As the woman shot the first blast towards him, Lance insitncitvely made a big jump about 3 or 4 blocks which made both himself and the woman hugely surprised. He dodged the first blast but the woman took out a remote control from his bag and pressed a button. Immediately, a pair of killer bots came out of sand.

These robots were extremely expensive and equally dangerous. It was surprising that some bandit has such expensive robots just to take his wallet and bike which altogether wouldn't cost even a thousand. However, there wasn't time to think about this here and now. Lance tried to use his ability to move objects remotely to take the woman's weapon and he immediately tried shooting at the robots. Out of 3 shots, 2 was hit which didn't even slow down the robots and they were closing in, probably to kill him.

On the other side, the woman was even more surprised and now she had much fear inside. The jump and moving her gun out of her hand remotely. It seemed like magic, except that it was real right in front of her. Or perhaps she was just dreaming?

Lance was still trying to terminate or at least stop the robots but the blasts of the gun didn't seem to have even a little effect on either of the robots. One of the robots was too close to him which made Lance take another jump to somewhere away. His life was at stake, again and he had to make a choice. Either uncover his sword to get rid of them or try something else with the risk of his life.

He thought about moving the robots remotely just like he did with the weapon. He tried the trick on one of the robots, making it float about half a block in the air. The robot made a beep and uncovered its gun which made the other robot immediately doing the same, shooting at him. And he could not hold it any longer.

"Well, I think I haven't got much of a choice" he thought and uncovered his sword with an immediate jump to one of the robots. He made a hole in the first robot and at the same time used it as cover for the blasts coming from the other one. One of the robots was finally terminated. He used the terminated robot as cover to close on the other robot and finally he terminated both of them.

"It was a close one." he thought "I shouldn't leave witness and plus, she was trying to kill me." he looked for the woman. She wasn't there anymore, probably running away from him. He took the gun and followed the foot prints till he found the woman running away from him as fast as she could. He used her own gun to shoot her down and kill her. The first shot was a miss but the second one was hit to her leg that made her roll on the ground.

He was pretty sure this woman was not a simple bandit. As he was walking towards to finish her, she cried out loud "Please don't kill me, I have money, big notes. You can take them all." He said "You were trying to murder me".

"I have a little boy, he is 8 years old. My husband died years ago and I have to fill belly of mine and him. His name is Hiul." she continued "People in the city dislike giving job to a widow like me.".

As Lance liked to believe her, he also was sensing deception coming from the woman. "You want me to believe that these expensive and dangerous military robots are from a widow living with her son trying to make a living?" and he finished her. After that, he tried to find some ID or anything in her pockets which none he found. However there was a mark on her arm. It was some iconic thing forged onto her skin with extreme heat in some way so that probably, a removal was impossible forever. His best guess was someone, or some organization trying to kill him. For what reason, he could not say.

He turned back to the road to take his bike and continue his trip to the city. It was afternoon, now. And the cafe would close soon. When he got back to the bike, he noticed something extremely strange. The robots weren't there. Just some metal parts here and there.

----

As he arrived at the city, as quickly as he could he entered a cafe and unlocked one of the shared terminals with his ID. Immediately after unlock, he saw an announcement: "Two military killer robots were stolen from a military base last night. Anyone to find them was requested to bring the robots back and win a bounty for the service to the government". The model was NE555. He tried to lookup this online. Few information about these killer robots were available. The government had announced and uncovered development of these 2 years ago. They could be programmed to target and kill most wanted criminals to clear the streets. And they could self destruct to cover the tails and destroy the internal memory. The memory didn't support encryption therefore a destruction was necessary to cover the programming.

He had 30 minutes left till the cafe would close. He had to find about the planet. He didn't know anything about the planet but if he could see an image of it, he could definitely recognize it. A good start was filtering only planets with at least 90% water surface. There was 50 planets and a moon with such a property. He had to see all 51 of them to find the one in his vision which would take a lot given the load time for each image. "The next time I should use a cafe with some better network connection" he thought "I could see few of them today and the rest tomorrow morning."

As he saw the first image, he realized two more parameters he could add to the search to narrow down the results more: The planet in his vision had only one big ocean and two continents. As he added the new parameters, there was only one result pumping up. The planet "Ju".

"The planet Ju is a medium sized planet with 93.4% water surfuce and two small continents on the east and west polars. As of 1k2, the planet has a population of 120 million residents which are almost equally distributed on both continents. In early 1k5, the official state was overthrown by a group of rebels and thus the planet is no longer part of the Galactic Republic. Status of King Jamp, the former king of the planet is now unknown along with his son Davus Jamp."

He now knows something worth about the planet and yet he could not say if Ashla is giving him a mission of warning him about something. Either way, it is time for him to head back to the village or more bandits might show up on the road in the absence of light.
