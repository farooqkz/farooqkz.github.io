### The beginning; The first vision

A planet with just one big ocean and two continents on the east and
the west polars. Lance wakes up.
He was having another dream. First time Lance had one of these dreams,
it was about murder of his mother, the only family he had in life.
And the last time before brought him a sword.
His sword is rather interesting and very different.
And he knew if the people realize such a thing exists,
they would try to replicate or steal it and then use it for unlawful
purposes, probably murder.
It would become chaos and one with such a weapon
could have much power, even more than the entire police force and their fancy weapons.
That's why Lance had used his sword just once when his life was at stake.

The last time he had such dreams, or more precisely,
visions, it was a mission to construct a sword, one which currently
he has in possess.
Someone, or something was talking to him indirectly in his
sleep so that he could realize something about the future
or to give him a mission.

This time, Lance was uncertain if this dream is a mission
for him or the entity is trying to tell him, maybe warn him, about the future.
If he knew his first dream could become real soon after, perhaps his
mother was still alive. But he could only plan for future, not for the past.

"If I could learn more about this planet, maybe I could realize if it's a mission or something else" he said to himself.
The Source was the name he had chosen for the entity talking to him in his sleeps.
Lance thinks Source is also the same entity giving him the powers and skills.
Sometimes he was wondering if there was someone else in this galaxy
with the same abilities and sensibilites as he has.

Unfortunately, his home didn't have a connection to the planet's network. Obviously the government had no incentive to provide a network connection to a village with only 9 residents who are almost only elderly people. These grandpas and grandmas haven't got a terminal, let alone usage of a network connection.

He always wished he had a terminal to access the one of the central computers in the nearby city. Money, however, was a big problem for a mere worker like him.

After some thinking, he decided to use one of those shared terminals in the cafe in the city center. The government was providing free of charge shared access terminals, 60 hours a month for all citizens. From there, he could access the galaxy map and find out about the planet in his vision.

### The government agent

As Lance was distancing from the village, he saw someone on the road side asking for help. It seemed a poor woman in trouble. He always believed in helping people and therefore he made a stop to see if he could be of any assist to her.

He stopped and went off the bike. "Thank you! Thank you so much. I've tried to get help here but there are few transports passing and none of them stop." the women cried to him. "What's the problem, ma'am? Do you need some help?" Lance asked. "Yeah sure" the woman said while she was taking something from her bag "Your wallet and bike could worth a few hundreds" she smiled while pointing her gun towards him.

As the woman shot the first blast towards him, Lance made a big jump entirely out of instinct. It was about 3 or 4 blocks which made both himself and the woman hugely surprised. He dodged the first blast but the woman took out a remote control from his bag and pressed a button. Immediately, a pair of killer bots came out of sand.

These robots were extremely expensive and equally dangerous. It was surprising that some bandit has such expensive robots just to take his wallet and bike which altogether wouldn't cost even a thousand. However, there wasn't time to think about this here and now. Lance tried to use his ability to move objects through the Source to take the woman's weapon and he immediately tried shooting at the robots. Out of 3 shots, 2 was hit which even didn't slow down the robots and they were closing in, probably to kill him.

On the other side, the woman was even more surprised and now she had much fear inside. The jump and moving her gun out of her hand remotely. It seemed like magic in fairly tales, except that it was real right in front of her. Or perhaps she was just dreaming?

Lance was still trying to terminate or at least stop the robots but the blasts of the gun didn't seem to have even a little bit effect on either of the robots. One of the robots was too close to him which made Lance take another jump back away. His life was at stake, again and he had to make a choice. Either uncover his sword to get rid of them or try something else with the risk of his life.

He thought about moving the robots remotely just like he did with the weapon. He tried the trick on one of the robots, making it float about half a block in the air. The robot made a beep and uncovered its gun which made the other robot immediately doing the same, shooting at him. And he could not hold it any longer.

"Well... I think I haven't got much of a choice" he thought and uncovered his sword with an immediate jump to one of the robots. He made a hole in the first robot in one of them using his saber. One of the robots was finally terminated. He used the terminated robot body as a cover to close on the other robot and finally he terminated both of them.

"It was a close one." he thought "I shouldn't leave witness and plus, she was trying to kill me." he looked for the woman. She wasn't there anymore, probably running away from him. He took the gun and followed the foot prints till he found the woman running away from him as fast as she could. He used her own gun to shoot her down and kill her. The first shot was a miss but the second one was hit to her leg that made her roll on the ground.

He was pretty sure this woman was not a simple bandit. As he was walking towards to finish her, she cried out loud "Please don't kill me, I have money, a huge number of them. You can take them all." He said "You were trying to kill me".

"I have a little boy, he is 8 years old. My husband died years ago and I have to fill belly of mine and him. His name is Hiul." she continued "People in the city dislike giving job to a widow like me.".

As Lance liked to believe her, he also was sensing deception coming from the woman. "I can't believe these military grade droids are owned by a widow who is desperate for only few hundreds of credits" Lance replied and then he finished her. After that, he tried to find some ID or anything in her pockets but he found none. However there was a mark on her arm. It was some iconic thing forged onto her skin with extreme heat in some way so that probably, a removal was impossible forever. His best guess was someone, or some organization trying to kill him. For what reason, he could not say.

He turned back to the road to take his bike and continue his trip to the city. It was afternoon, now. And the cafe would close soon. When he got back to the bike, he noticed something extremely strange. The robots weren't there. Just some metal parts here and there. Perhaps someone had exploded them? This way identification of the origin of the droids was about impossible. But he was in a hurry. So he left the site with his bike.

While on the route, Lance was thinking to the incident and the woman who wanted to kill him. Something felt wrong and out of place. He shouldn't have killed the woman. He could maybe just wipe out her memory. Finding a memory wiper device is not easy at all and can be found only in government facilities or in the hand of criminals. "Killing people must be a last resort, not a first" said Lance to himself and he continued "No more kills from now on, at least as much as possible".

### In the cafe

As he arrived at the city, as quickly as he could he entered a cafe and unlocked one of the shared terminals with his ID. Immediately after unlock, he saw an announcement: "Two military killer robots were stolen from a military base last night. Anyone to find them was requested to bring the droids back and win a bounty for the service to the society". The model was NE282. He tried to lookup this online. Other than the photos from the announcement, few information was available about them. The government had announced and uncovered development of these 2 years ago. They could be programmed to target and kill wanted criminals, droid or otherwise, to clear the streets. And they could self destruct to cover the tails and destroy the internal memory. The memory didn't support encryption therefore a destruction was necessary to cover the programming.

He had 30 minutes left till the cafe would close. And He had to find about the planet. He didn't know anything about the planet but if he could see an image of it, he could definitely recognize it. A good start was filtering only planets with at least 90% water surface. There was 50 planets and a moon with such a property. He had to see all 51 of them to find the one in his vision which would take a lot given the load time for each image. "The next time I should use a cafe with some better network connection" he thought "I could see few of them today and the rest tomorrow morning."

As he saw the first image, he realized two more parameters he could add to the search to narrow down the results more: The planet in his vision had only one big ocean and two continents. As he added the new parameters, there was only one result pumping up. The planet "Ju Siran".

"The planet Ju Siran is a medium sized planet with 93.4% water surface and two small continents on the east and west polars. As of 1k2, the planet has a population of 120 million residents which are almost equally distributed on both continents. In early 1k5, the official state was overthrown by a group of rebels and thus the planet is no longer part of the Galactic Republic. Status of King Siran, the former ruler of the planet is now unknown along with his daughter Davus Siran."

He now knows something about the planet and yet he could not say if Ashla is giving him a mission of warning him. Either way, it is time for him to head back to the village or more bandits might show up on the road in the absence of light.

### The second vision

A little girl is reflecting stun blasts coming from an automatic turret using a laser sword he has which is just like Lance's. "You are doing great, Davus!" says King Siran to the little girl. "A great master taught me" says Davus. Lance wakes up. Another vision and this with his last vision sum up in a meaningful way. He is supposed to teach his skills to the little daughter of King Siran. Interestingly and also strangely, he doesn't know how to reflect blasts with his saber. Perhaps he must first learn this skill and then teach it to the little girl taking him as an apprentice? Things are evolving with his powers.

Now he should learn the skill to reflect blasts. It could become extremely useful when he is trying to defend himself against other people and robots as well. Furthermore, perhaps he could reflect the blasts back to their origin and this way he could destroy the origin as well. "Sounds cool" says Lance to himself. But where should he get started? "I will dive right in the middle and learn." plans Lance. Though just diving in wouldn't be much of a plan.

### The lightsaber training

Lance takes a trip to his workshop. He already had two automatic turrets somewhere which needed repair. He had bought them for parts. Now they could have a new use. After some struggle, he finally finds one of them. "It's in a decent shape" says Lance to himself. He sets it to the virtual blast mode, carries it to the desert, places it somewhere, turns it on and walks few blocks away from it. The turret starts firing, and the first blast hits Lance. So does the second, the third and up the the tenth till Lance starts jumping.

"Lance you are supposed to reflect them not dodge them" says Lance to himself. He turns off the turret to take a break. Ignites his lightsaber and thinks. Then reconfigures the turret to fire in only two direction on the left and the right. Finally, he turns the automatic turret on again. He holds the lightsaber on the left direction. Some blasts come and hit his sword and then reflect while some others hit Lance. "Nice! At least I'm not entirely out of luck" says Lance to himself. And suddenly he notices the sun is setting. He turns off the turret and carries it back to his workshop. He feels hungry and he hasn't worked today to get some money. Fortunately, he has some savings and he could avoid work up to a week.

After few tens of days, Lance is able to reflect much of the blasts away from him. But not all of them, not yet. One day, as he was training, one of the virtual blasts hits his left eye. This makes him power down his saber and touch his hit eye. Virtual blasts aren't harmful as long as they hit the skin. But if they hit a part like mouth or eyes, they aren't that harmless anymore. When hit an eye, it could blind the target for a few minutes. As he turns back to the turret, blasts hit his back which is annoying but not harmful. He can't see things with his left eye and it hurts a little bit. One of the blasts hits right in his kneecap and makes him fall into the sound on his face. As sand enters his eyes, now he is totally blind.

"FREAK!" Lance shouts. The blasts are still hitting him. Now something different happens. He can feel the movement of the blasts. He ignites his lightsaber and reflects some of the blasts, but not all of them. That day he learned a valuable lesson. He can feel the surroundings, probably through the same entity, the Source.

### Arriving at Ju Siran

After Lance had mastered every ability, he traveled to Ju Siran with some other Siranian folks. To travel to this planet, he first had to travel to another planet. Because from his homeworld, no transport was going directly there.

The Siranian accepted to take him there, in exchange for 300 republic credits. Their ship was quite old and in need of some repairs. But was functional. With 300 he could travel with a classy ship with all three meals. However, Lance wanted to use unregistered methods of transport. After all, he wasn't an ordinary man.

The travel wasn't that long. They arrived destination, the West continent of Ju Siran, the Siranians wished luck for Lance, and he went on his way to find the family of King Siran.

While Lance was walking in the streets, there was news everywhere about how great the revolution was and that the leadership is great. On the top, there was someone named Shep Siran. No one had ever seen him in the public. And the advertisements were inducing that Shep Siran is a Siran family member who wants to bring Republic and Democracy to the planet, instead of Kingship of the Siran family.

Lance found a food store, to eat something as he was starving and also in the hope of some information about King Siran's family or about everything. While at it, he tried to pay the shopkeeper with some Republic credits. This surprised everyone. "How did you come up with republic credits? You must be a traveler!" the shopkeeper responded. The conversation then ran:

- Yeah I'm not from here. I'm from somewhere distant.
- Not many offworlders here. There are very few ships traveling to our watery planet. And when they do, the Shep's government takes all the republic credits and give the offworlders the local credits.
- How have you got local credits? All the planets trade with republic credits.
- I guess Shep loves introducing credits with his name on the plates. Rather than the Republic. Also we aren't a republic member anymore. And we have few planet to planet trades anymore.
- I see. But I don't have your local credits.
- Oh I would be glad to take some of your republic credits and give you the local ones.
- Hahaha that would be something.
- See! This is a good trade. Both parties benefit.

And the shopkeeper gave the change money with local credits, which were quite a quantity. Then he continued "I don't have more local credits here in the shop, maybe you would like a decent drink and some more food?". Lance replied "I'm kinda full. But I would appreciate the drink. Let's assume you owe me some" and he smiled.

As Lance was at the shop's door to leave, he crashed with a lady with beefy muscles. The lady apologized. "No harm done" Lance smiled. "Have a good time, pal. In the case I didn't return for the rest of money, you can simply have them." he said to the shopkeeper.

### The thugs

In the next day, Lance was walking in some very lowly crowded street. There were more birds and cats than people. The same lady from the food shop was coming with few men and women from behind Lance. They caged Lance.

"Let's get things done quickly" said the woman. "You give me your republic credits and in exchange we won't kill you." she finished and dragged her big sword and blaster out. "You don't want my credits" Lance replied. "You are going to go home and forget about all these." he continued.

Then the men and women behind repeated "We don't want your credits" and started walking while seeming quite confused. The woman shouted "What the freak? When I say we want these credits, you better listen you dumbheads". And the thugs immediately snapped out of confusion and replied "Oh yeah sure!". "I think I can buy a good blaster like yours with my share" said one of the thugs.

The woman started to look into Lance's pockets and he found the saber. "Oh this is quite weird and interesting at the same time" she said. "I think you are giving this to me as a payment for saving your life" she laughed. While she was pointing the lightsaber to her chest, she asked "what does this button do?". Lance replied "Don't press it, I beg you!". The woman petted Lance and said "And if I do?". "You might not live to regret it" Lance replied. The woman hit Lance in the stomach and said "I suggest to behave if you want to live in one piece". As soon as she ignited the lightsaber, it went through her chest coming out of the back. And she dropped on the ground and went unconcious, maybe dead.

The other thugs dragged out their blasters. But Lance used the Source to drag the blasters out of their hands. Which made them shout "Wizard!" and run away.

Lance went to the captain and tried to sense her pulse under her neck. "Good to not have a second" and he continued "I begged you to not press the freaking button. Didn't I?"
