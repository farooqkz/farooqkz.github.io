I've been always saying this. Multiple times on Mastodon. Western powers such as Israel, the US and their supporters have a habit of marking people, groups and organizations as "terrorists". Then they won't say they are fighting Palestinians, Russians or Iranians. They call Hamas a terrorist group to justify fighting them and mass murdering them. The Iranian regime has a similar habit and they murder or execute citizens by marking them as ["Wahabi"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wahhabism), ["Salafi"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salafi_movement) and "Separatist".

Propaganda come from everywhere. And some people unknowingly follow this passively. It's both interesting and disturbing that the Western governments call Hamas or Iran's Revolutionary Guard as "terrorist" groups or organizations. And when Israel military murders military leaders right in their homes or bases, that's "self defense" and "necessary for its national security".

During the recent war between Israel and Iran, at least hundreds of my people were killed. And during the Hamas Israel war, thousands of Palestine people were murdered. Many many more were displaced. In both wars with Hamas and Iran, Israel signaled that people leave some regions as they want to do bombardments. Where people are supposed to go? And what right does Israel have to command people to leave their homelands?

My people are being strike from both inside and out. During the war, we had some form of light Martial law. Iran's regime has full control of the domestic medias and the Internet. For more than 48 hours, they blocked the Internet routes to and from outside the country. Forcefully keeping people in darkness about what's happening. We had checkpoints everywhere in the country. The way they were checking things, was obvious they aren't really trying to catch Israeli spies. Rather inducing fear in the people. Maybe afraid of another protest. The price of goods did a big jump of 50-100%, making the situation even worse.
