The title might be misleading. You won't read here why [Porn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pornography) is good. You'll rather read what good aspects does Porn have.

In my opinion, as son of a [Muslim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslims)(and not necessarily a Muslim),
everything which God has created has some good aspects greater than its bad aspects or God would not have
created it. It's simple: All God wants is good and has the power to do
so(e.g. God is [omnipotent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omnipotence)) and also the wisdom to do so.

So what is the good aspect of Porn? Learning how to have sex with your wife?
Of course not! There are several articles in [Sexology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexology) as well as
[Psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology) stating watching Porn has bad effects on one's sexual life.

As you probably know, different people in different situations have different behaviors. For example when I'm tired or had little sleep, at the end of the day you could make me angry easily yelling at you. As for Porn, when some groups of boys are watching Porn together(or at least pretending to it) and inviting others around to do so, you'll have a chance to *know* people. There are some who happily accept the invite and some who refuse it. You've got a chance to recognize those who refuse and don't do dirty jobs.

From this point of view, even existence of Satan/Devil seems good: You can test, ditinguish and recognize those who listen to Satan and those who refuse. And this might be an answer to [the problem of Evil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_of_evil).

#### A comment
