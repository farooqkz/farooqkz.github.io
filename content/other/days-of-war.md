Living in Iran has tons of downsides, especially for a programmer like me. But when the June war started, now it's even worse. Here I want to keep a mini diary about each day of war. I live in quite a peaceful city with little or no sign of missles, drones or jets. However, this absolutely does not mean we are okay. We weren't okay before war. And now it's even worse.

If you are interested in learning about Iran Israel war from someone who lived in Iran during the time, here you are.

## Before war

### The economy

Before the war between Iran and Israel start, we weren't living exactly a quite life. Or a good one. When I was a kid, each US Dollar was like 10,000 Iranian Rials. Now at the time of writing this, I'm 24 and each USD is 960,000 Iranian Rials. This means ruined economy and inflation. 

Over years, I saw that more and more of my poor people are looking in the trashcans to find something useful. If we go back to like 2015, there weren't many people looking into trashcans. And those who had this business, were looking for metals, glasses and such these. They were looking to find them and then sell them for a price. The ones doing so were men with addictions to drugs, mostly. When they are addicted to them, they usually end up losing their job.

However, in the recent few years, let's say from 2021 to 2025, it's different. Each time I go out of our small town to the city, I would definitely see many men and women, usually young or maybe too young, looking for *anything* good in the trashcans. We've seen many instances in which those people are literally looking for food, for something to eat in the garbage. We've seen people who find some food, maybe a piece of a bread, cake, biscuits or maybe some milk, take it out of the trashcans and eat them. Each time I've seen such a scene, it had a big influence on me.

This is just the surface of my people's life. If you go deeper, you probably will see some stuff far worse than such these. I usually try to not think about these. It hurts. It really hurts.

### Censorship

I never have seen my country without sanctions or censorship of the Internet or the media. There is no such thing as free radio or TV or media within the country. The only TV is the one which is "National TV". It goes the same about radio. And you cannot simply start a newspaper or news website in this country. There has been, however, instances where people had a website and were operating it from outside. There are foreign medias in Persian language. Including Satellite TV. They have been always illegal. At one point, the police was actively searching for dishes.

About Internet, the regime always had full control over it and it was rapidly censoring websites or certain IPs or ports. And whenever there was a situation, the regime blocked connection to outside of the country. I remember it happened at least like 4 or 5 times during the protests. Right now as I'm writing this, during the June war, I have very very limited access. However, I still can push commits to my website's repository on Github to publish this note. The routes to the outside are heavily blocked. I can't even see my own Persian blog or Wikipedia. DuckDuckGo is also gone. Details vary from ISP to ISP. They also have disabled IPv6 completely.

### Sanctions

I also don't remember any day without a sanction. If you want to use the web services in the US, you definitely cannot do it with your Iranian IP. Purchasing goods from outside the country, like Amazon or Aliexpress is not much of a thing. Not that it's impossible. But to evade the sanctions, you have to pay some money and time. Also we cannot really receive money from outside. Our banking system is not connected to the International systems.

To live with the sanctions, you either have to forget about almost anything outside the country. Or that you have to pay a price to evade them. Like to purchase from an online shop, you need someone in another country to receive it and then get it to you in Iran. There are companies which do this business. They have some office in the US, the UAE, the UK, Germany or other countries which receive the goods and then they deliver to you in Iran. Sometimes you have to pay twice the price to get it.

## Day -1: the day before war

This day would be Thursday, 12th June. I was working in the office. Iran and the US were in the middle of negotiations. The US wanted Iran to let anything nuclear go. Iran was insisting that it cannot let go of Uranium enrichment. They were also insisting that the negotiations are "indirect". That is the Iran officials don't talk directly to the US ones. There were rumors that Iran has enough enriched Uranium to build a nuclear bomb. And that they are buying time to finally make one and then become immortal.

## Day 0: Israel attacks important sites and murders important people

It was Friday. In the morning we realized that Israel has attacked. They murdered many high ranking military officials as well as nuclear scientists. They also had attacked nuclear sites and military bases.

It was peaceful in where I was, Bandar Abbas. However, censorship of the Internet connections started. In channels six, they were harshly talking about Israel and were promising "a hard revenge for Iran's people".
