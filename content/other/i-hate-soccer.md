I'm not talking about soccer itself but this business around soccer which is really awful. I hate it and I have got an ideology behind.

Soccer players and other sport players get too much salary and fame(players of other sports probably get less) they don't deserve. I think most people agree with this if not all. You can compare this to salaries of doctors rescuing you and your family or the farmer which you would die of hunger if they weren't or a writer or a teacher.

But why do players get so much? Simply, because people pay attention to them. Sport fans from one year or months before a game, buy tickets. And they are greedy to buy clothes of players, their ball, and other their stuff. A part of this money goes to players' bank accounts. another part goes to other people's account participating in this business. So why do they get so much money? Because you give!

Here, many may argue that they don't spend money on these. And that they just watch or follow. This argument is not valid as you help them become more and more famous and thus, other people who want to spend money, get more attracted.

_NOTE: Unfortunately, players are not the only group who get a lot of wealth. Also actors and actresses receive too much money because of us. But now, it is world cup and that's why I've written about soccer players instead of actors/actresses._
