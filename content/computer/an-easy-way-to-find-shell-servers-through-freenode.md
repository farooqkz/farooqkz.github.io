Other than [this website](http://shells.red-pill.eu/) and your favorite search engine, there is another way to find shell servers. Connect to freenode(it's an [IRC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IRC) network). Then type this command and press enter: `/msg alis list *shells` It will send you a list of IRC channels their name ending with "shells", not all of them are IRC channels of shell servers nor all of them are free(as in price).

**Edit:** Nowadays as of 2021 you might want to check [LiberaChat](https://libera.chat), too.
