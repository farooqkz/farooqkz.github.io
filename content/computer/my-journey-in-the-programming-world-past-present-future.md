After more than 7 years of programming, I thought my story is worth recording before it gets buried under lots of newer memories. I usually don't save memories for later in the hope that I would be able to keep space for the other more important stuff. Of course, I might be simply wrong.

## The beginning

So the story begins when I was about 12 or 13, my uncle had bought me a very small book: Website design using WYDIWYG Web builder software or something like that. At that time I had absolutely no idea what a computer is and how does it work. I am not much of follower for these sort of books. I rather prefer to experiment myself and learn by trial and error. The book is only necessary when I am lost somewhere.

Using the software introduced in the book, I built a very small web page. Because I didn't have a genuine copy of the software, my webpage had small problems, for instance its title was always `Untitled` or something. And I think it wasn't optimized for size and performance at all.

The advantage of that book, which my uncle had bought me, and the other books from the same publisher was that they weren't big, heavy and slow read but rather straighforward and very light. The title of most or all of these books from that publisher was "the key to X" where X was something about technology which the author or authors wanted to teach.

After reading that book, I become interested and bought two other books from the same publisher: "The key to Visual C#" and "The key to Actionscript". I didn't read the latter but became deep in the first. My first program with Visual C#, not surprisingly, was a button which showed the message "Me is Virus" after clicking on it. Funny, isn't it?

I never spend more time with Actionscript but went deep down in C# in the later years coding many other programs, including a program for doing children's mathematical homeworks in Batch with a special shortcut key for self-destruction when the parents were approaching close.

## Another one with interest in CS

By the time I entered a SAMPAD school, I had found someone else having the same interests as mine. So we became close friends developing our knowledge together tempting each other to experience what each have experienced.

## Moving to Ubuntu and Python in 2015

Before 2015, I had several tries for installing Ubuntu but I didn't became interested and I had old versions of Ubuntu. Suddenly somewhere around 2015 I thought "I should really try this" and completely replaced my Windows 7 with Ubuntu 12.04.

There was no C# in Ubuntu and my machine didn't have access to the Internet to install softwares and even if it had, I had no idea how could I have C# while in Linux. So I had two new options which were preinstalled on my Ubuntu: Python and C.

I tried to learn them both but later I went more deep in Python. Now thinking to it I don't remember why Python and why not C. Perhaps because Python was easier. In the next years I developed my knowledge in Python and Linux command line. It was a very interesting experience.

Later, our home got an Internet connection, an ADSL one, which we still have it and I entered a world where Chinese bots were trying to break into my sshd-enabled machine. I also used to host a mini Mumble server and having it on most of the day with myself online in it.

One year before university I tried Common Lisp to be my secondary language and for academic purposes and continued learning it till the first year of university. Sadly CL is an abandoned language despite having many interesting features such as Macros with which one can add new kinds of loops to the language.

## Entering University

In 2019, I entered Hormozgan University to have my bachelor degree in CS. Surprisingly, they were going to teach Python and my experience with it was much more of that of the others even those who were supposed to teach me. Passing FP and AP with good overall points, I became the TA of AP.

Being a TA, I realized that for most students, programming and thinking rationally is so hard to get used to especially in the limited time of a semester for AP and a semester for FP. So that's why most of them pass DSA-1 in two or in some cases more semester than one. Of course the professor who is in charge there affects this greatly.
