Years ago, when I was in early highschool, I found Minetest CTF game. Back then, it was introduced by rubenwardy and it had only one map. Mainly because it was a FOSS project, and because contributions were welcome, people joined to help with development and later with map making when multi maps were supported.

And when ruben lost interest in developing the game, he wisely handed it over to savilli and LandarVargan(or LoneWolf) to continue its development. The nature of a FOSS project is that, it is unstoppable and yet efficient. Because the source code which is needed to run the game is available under a free(as in freedom) licence, and because the maintainers warmly welcome the contributions, a FOSS project usually lives long without proper funding and without support of a company.

> I started development to create a game where players made countries and castles and fought each other. It would have been similar to persistent kingdoms today. At some point I switched to making CTF instead, with temporary maps rather than persistent, to make it easier to test the code. --rubenwardy


### 2015, the birthyear of Minetest CTF

Let's do a small journey back to mid-2015 when we had the first commit of Minetest CTF by rubenwardy. I joined the server to play the game sometime in 2016 I believe. The server was small, frequently laggy and was hosted by rubenwardy on DigitalOcean. There was only one map which we had to play over and over and we didn't have multiple game modes like we have now. Steel sword was the thing which was making players unkillable as the only other sword was stone sword! Shotgun wasn't spraying bullets but had rather a single bullet which could remove wood or stone blocks. My hobby was hiding in the trees and shooting the enemy base blocks down one by one!

### 2017, multiple maps

Now let's go about 2 years forward. We have multiple maps. Yes! We don't have to play a single map over and over. And people are slowly starting to submit their own maps to the game. We also have got grenades and SMGs in game. The pro chest requirement is a few thousands of score.

### 2019, more maps!

4 years later in 2019, we have new blocks to make our base defences. There was a bug in which when you right click on many stones, a furnace form is showed. This bug has been fixed sometime in 2019. Also a map catalog is being added and also more maps are being added.

### 2021

6 years later in 2021, I see some commits from LoneWolfHT. People were formerly complaining about their teammates stealing their kills and now we have kill assists. And in this year, CTF v3.0 gets released which mainly introduces multiple modes!

### 2021 till present

During this period, one of the core developers, savilli, has left. And we are pacing slower. However, we have got some new contributors some of which are youths.
