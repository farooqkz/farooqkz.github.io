Recently, a friend and coworker, [Holger Krekel](https://chaos.social/@hpk), is making a series of micro posts on Mastodon about screens, online time and online experience.

To be honest, I don't know this man much. I've been with little contact with him. And at work, he doesn't show up much. Needless to say that he manages higher level stuff for the family of projects we've got, while I directly code for one of these projects.

But even with little interactions in work and on Mastodon, I can sense he has some valuable lessons to share with the others. Especially when it comes to smart devices. And the insight he posses is not only about technical stuff. In fact, I can make little opinion about his technical knowledge, because we didn't have the necessary kind of interactions.

What I am talking about here, is about culture and health. Smart devices, including smart phones, PCs, tablets and all these, need to be used in the right and healthy way. Otherwise, they will hurt us.

Again, the insight he offers doesn't seem about screen time and the harmful effect on eyes. Of course that matters, too. But one wouldn't call it insight as the screen being harmful has been scientifically proven. We are talking about something in the lines of mental health and health of the information we consume.

These I am talking about are relevant to myself, my character, my ethics and my goals. And may be compatible with yours or not. In fact, I think, one shouldn't load their mind with too much information. Do you sometimes feel while you must be concentrating on your work, or the read, you are rather distracted by things which are irrelevant, at the moment or at all?

I believe notifications, both the pop up messages and the counter badge, are quite harmful to concentration. That's why I suggest getting rid of most of them. Here's a bunch of advises which work for me, and might work for you, too.

 - While working, set your phone to vibrate or even silence, and don't receive notifications, big or small, going on your phone. An exception could be calls.
 - Don't expose your phone number to any organization or in the public. This will lead spammers to you either calling or texting. The same could go for your Email address or social handles/IDs.
 - Maybe opt for a feature phone. Note that a feature phone can be a dumbphone or a smart phone. A dumbphone by my definition has got only calling and texting features. It can't connect to the Internet. But might be able to provide tethering for other devices. A smart feature phone has got a connection. But is limited. You can opt for a KaiOS feature phone if you are based in Africa or the US. You can read more why I chose a KaiOS phone over an Android phone in [this blog post on BananaHackers blog](https://blog.bananahackers.net/farooqkz/kaios-is-a-good-choice-for-you-if)
 - Disable any sort of notifications which aren't urgent on your PC. It includes the counter badges, maybe the badges entirely and also the popup message. You have various methods depending on your PC configuration to opt out of receiving notifications for some time or at all. For instance on KDE Plasma, you can disable the notifications. Other options include disconnecting the connection and closing the apps which send notifications and opening them as needed.
 - Unfortunately, these days you need a connection for most of the jobs you are doing. For me, as a programmer/coder/developer/geek, it's essential to have a connection to read the manuals, documentations, search the forums and QA websites. I really wished there was a local first approach, at least for something like StackOverflow, Reddit and Discourse. Unfortunately, the quality search engines are in the hands of few and propriety. But when we have local first apps and websites, we could entirely disconnect from the Internet to concentrate better on the work, research or the read.

All these advises are based on a single principle: You don't need to be online all the time. You don't need to receive notifications all the time. And don't worry, if someone had a life or death situation, they will call you!
