In Islam, given the verses from Quran and Hadiths from the Prophet Muhammad, Muslims believe that one day Jesus will return to fight AntiChrist(or in Arabic, Dajjal the Messiah) and will be ruler of Muslims after that for sometime. Here I give a summary of evidence within religious sources about this.

In Quran, at least in two verses, this is discussed. First in [43:61](https://quran.com/43/61) Quran says:

> And indeed he/it is a sign of the hour so do not have doubt about it and follow. This is the Straight path.

To realize what does "he" or "it" mean here, we should refer to the former verses:

From 43:57 it says:

> When the son of Mary was cited as an example, your people broke into laughing. They said "which is better? our gods or Jesus". They cite him only to argue. In fact they are a people prone to dispute. He was only a servant we favored upon him and made him an example for the Children of Israel. And has we willed, we could easily replace you with Angels succeeding on the land. And he is a sign of the hour so do not be doubtful and follow me. This is the straight path.

As we can see, it is most likely that this "he/it" there is pointing to "the Son of Mary" or in other word, "Jesus". So from this verse we understand that Jesus is a sign of the hour. But this doesn't necessarily indicate that there is a second coming of Jesus and that is a sign of the Hour. Another possible conclusion is that the first coming of Jesus is a sign of the Hour and there is no second coming.

Now we read some other verses, starting at [4:155](https://quran.com/4?startingVerse=155):

> And for breaking their covenant, rejecting God's signs, killing the prophets unjustly and for their saying "Our hearts are unreceptive". It is God who has sealed their hearts for their disbelief so they do not believe except for a few. And for their rejection and their saying about Mary, an outrageous accusation. And their saying we killed the Messiah, Jesus son of Mary, the Messenger of God. And they didn't kill him and didn't crucified him. But it was made to appear so. Even those who argue about this are in doubt. They don't have any knowledge, only assuming. They certainly didn't kill him. Rather, God raised him up to himself. And God is Almighty and all wise. And there is no one from the People of the Scripture except that they believe in him before his death. And on the Judgement day he will be a witness against them.

If we also read the former verses, we see God is talking about Jews who denied Jesus and Muhammad. The same who accused Mary and they thought they killed Jesus. As you can see, the common Muslim belief that Jesus was not killed comes from this verse. God says they didn't kill Jesus but it was made to appear so. As far as I know, there aren't Hadiths from the Prophet on "how" it was appeared so. Though you can find some stories here and there.

Later God says that all of the People of Scripture will believe in Jesus before his death. Now here is the interesting part. God first says that Jesus was not killed, then it says that Christians and Jews will believe in Jesus before his death. This can't be possible unless there is a second coming of Jesus.

Summing up these all these verses, as a sign of the Hour, there is a second coming of Jesus and that the People of the Scripture will believe in him before his death. So as you can see, even without referring to the Hadiths from the Prophet, we can conclude second coming of Jesus from Quran.
