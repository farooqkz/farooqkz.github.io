In Islam, given the verses from Quran and Hadiths from the Prophet Muhammad, Muslims believe that one day Jesus will return to fight AntiChrist(or in Arabic, Dajjal the Messiah) and will be ruler of Muslims for sometime. Here I give a summary of evidence within Quranic verses about this.

> Before I continue, it is worth of note that the name "Jesus" has many forms in different languages. If you read the Arabic text of Quran, you will encounter the word "عیسی" which is pronounced "Isa". Interestingly, the Arab Christians don't use "Isa" to refer to Jesus as far as I know. They use the word "یسوع" which is pronounced "Yasu'". The name Jesus or Isa was a common name among Jews, it is the same as "یوشع" pronounced "Yushe'". In English it is "Joshua" which still today, is a common name among the Western people.

In Quran, at least in two verses, the second coming of Jesus Christ is discussed. First in [43:61](https://quran.com/43/61) Quran says:

> And indeed he/it is a sign of the Hour so do not have doubt about it and follow. This is the Straight path.

To realize what does "he" or "it" mean here, we should refer to the former verses:

From [43:57](https://quran.com/43/61) it says:

> When the son of Mary was cited as an example, your people broke into laughing. They said "Which is better? our gods or Jesus". They cite him only to argue. In fact they are a people prone to dispute. He was only a servant we favored upon him and made him an example for the Children of Israel. And had we willed, we could easily replace you with Angels succeeding on the land. And he is a sign of the Hour so do not be doubtful and follow me. This is the straight path.

As we can see, it is most likely that this "he/it" there is pointing to "the Son of Mary" or differently speaking, "Jesus". So from this verse we understand that Jesus is a sign of the Hour(the Judgement day). But this doesn't necessarily indicate that there is a second coming of Jesus and that is a sign of the Hour. Another possible conclusion is that the first coming of Jesus is a sign of the Hour, and there is no second coming.

Now we read some other verses, starting at [4:155](https://quran.com/4?startingVerse=155):

> And for breaking their covenant, rejecting God's signs, killing the prophets unjustly and for saying "Our hearts are unreceptive". It is God who has sealed their hearts for their disbelief so they do not believe except for a few. And for their rejection and their saying about Mary, an outrageous accusation. And their saying we killed the Messiah, Jesus son of Mary, the Messenger of God. And they didn't kill him and didn't crucified him. But it was made to appear so. Even those who argue about this are in doubt. They don't have any knowledge, only assuming. They certainly didn't kill him. Rather, God raised him up to himself. And God is Almighty and all wise. And there is no one from the People of the Scripture except that they believe in him before his death. And on the Judgement day he will be a witness against them.

If we also read the former verses, we read God is talking about Jews who denied Jesus and Muhammad. The same who accused Mary and they thought they killed Jesus. As you can see, the common Muslim belief that Jesus was not killed comes from this verse. God says they didn't kill Jesus but it was made to appear so. As far as I know, there aren't Hadiths from the Prophet on "how" it was appeared so. Though you can find some stories here and there, from other sources, including [the Gospel of Barnabas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gospel_of_Barnabas).

Later God says that all or most of the People of Scripture will believe in Jesus before his death. Now here is the interesting part. God first says that Jesus was not killed, then it says that Christians and Jews will believe in Jesus before his death. This can't be possible unless there is a second coming of Jesus.

Summing up these all these verses, as a sign of the Hour, there is a second coming of Jesus and that the People of the Scripture will believe in him before his death. So as you can see, even without referring to the Hadiths from the Prophet Muhammad, we can conclude second coming of Jesus from Quran.
