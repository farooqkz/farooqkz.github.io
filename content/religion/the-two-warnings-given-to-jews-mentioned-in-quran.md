The verses in the beginning of the 17th chapter of Quran, talk about two warnings given to Jews which is mentioned in the Scripture or the Book.
Here you can read the translation of verses in English:

>  Glory be to the One Who took His servant by night from the Sacred Mosque to the Farthest Mosque whose surroundings We have blessed, so that We may show him some of Our signs. Indeed, He alone is the All-Hearing, All-Seeing.
> And We gave Moses the Scripture and made it a guide for the Children of Israel,  "Do not take besides Me any other Trustee of Affairs",
> descendants of those We carried with Noah! He was indeed a grateful servant.
> And We warned the Children of Israel in the Scripture, “You will certainly cause corruption in the land twice, and you will become extremely arrogant.
> When the first of the two warnings would come to pass, We would send against you some of Our servants of great might, who would ravage your homes. This would be a warning fulfilled.
> Then We would give you the upper hand over them and aid you with wealth and offspring, causing you to outnumber them.
> If you act rightly, it is for your own good, but if you do wrong, it is to your own loss. “And when the second warning would come to pass, your enemies would totally disgrace you and enter the Temple as they entered it the first time, and utterly destroy whatever would fall into their hands.
> — Dr. Mustafa Khattab, the Clear Quran

For those who not already familiar with the litrature of Quran, "Children of Israel" is one of the names Quran uses to call what we call today, "Jews".

So Quran talks about two warnings given to Jews that they will cause corruption in the land and/or on Earth. As for the first time, "Some servants of God" and not "some of God's servant" would answer this corruption caused by them and "ravage" their homes.

First Quran says "Some of those who are our servant" or similar phrase and not "Some of our servants". In Arabic there are more than one way to state that something belongs to the other:

1. the thing +
