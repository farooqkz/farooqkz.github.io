A while ago, a Christian friend of mine, Ivan, asked me about the similarities and differences between
the Holy Bible and the Holy Quran. Since it might be the question of others as well, I thought writing a good post
will be much better than explaining to him in chat so that others can benefit from reading it.

When we want to compare to religious books, there are different aspects we can choose to compare them.
Here, I have chosen 3 aspects to compare the Christian Bible and the Quran of Muslims.

## The Faith

While both Christianity and Islam are monotheism religions, meaning there is only one God to worship, there is a difference between
the their views of this one God. The main difference is perhaps that most Christians believe in Trinity and this in Islam is disbelief in God.

In various verses Quran blames Christians for their beliefs about Jesus Christ. You can use [quran.com](https://quran.com) and search for "Jesus", "Christ" or "Messiah". As an example there is one verse from [Quran 5:72](https://quran.com/5/72) which tells us those who believe Jesus is God has certainly fall into disbelief:

> Those who say, “Allah is the Messiah, son of Mary,” have certainly fallen into disbelief. The Messiah said, “O Children of Israel! Worship Allah—my Lord and your Lord.” Whoever associates others with Allah will surely be forbidden Paradise by Allah. Their home will be the Fire. And the wrongdoers will have no helpers.

(Note that "Allah" simply means "God, the one god" in Arabic. It doesn't have plural form and refers to exactly one. Christians who are Arab also use the same word to refer to God and followers of other Abrahamic religions as well.)

On the other hand, there is conversation between God and Jesus in which God promises Jesus that those
who followed him(Jesus) will be elevated above those who didn't till the Judgement day:

> When Allah said, “O Jesus! I will take you and raise you up to Myself. I will deliver you from those who disbelieve, and elevate your followers above the disbelievers until the Day of Judgment. Then to Me you will all return, and I will settle all your disputes.

This verse is from [3:55](https://quran.com/3/55).

There are similarities between the attributes which Muslims believe God has and those which Christians, at least the majority of them, believe. Take this verse from [3:62](https://quran.com/3/62) as an example:

> Certainly, this is the true narrative, and there is no god except Allah. And indeed, Allah is the Almighty, All-Wise.

You can find in the end of a lot of verses attributes of God in Quran. I mention two other verses:

> He chooses whoever He wills to receive His mercy. And Allah is the Lord of infinite bounty.

In [3:74](https://quran.com/3/74)

> The Most Compassionate, taught the Quran, created humanity, taught them speech.

In [3:1-4](https://quran.com/55). The other alternative for "The Most Compassionate" is "The Most Merciful" which Quran mentions it as one the most important attributes of God.
