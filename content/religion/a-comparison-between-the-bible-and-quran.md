A while ago, a Christian friend of mine, Ivan, asked me about the similarities and differences between
the Holy Bible and the Holy Quran. Since it might be the question of others as well, I thought writing a good post
will be much better than explaining to him in chat so that others can benefit from reading it.

When we want to compare to religious books, there are different aspects we can choose to compare them.
Here, I have chosen 3 aspects to compare the Christian Bible and the Quran of Muslims.

## The Faith

While both Christianity and Islam are monotheism religions, meaning there is only one God to worship, there is a difference between
the their views of this one God. The main difference is perhaps that most Christians believe in Trinity(except [a very small group who don't](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nontrinitarianism)) and in Islam, this is disbelief in God.

There is no explict talk about Trinity in the Christian Bible to my knowledge, especially in the Old Testament and in the Gospels. However there are verses which makes scholars conclude Trinity. For instance this verse from [Mat 28:19](https://www.biblestudytools.com/kjv/matthew/28.html):

> Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:

Also this verse from [the John 10:30](https://www.biblestudytools.com/john/10-30.html):

> I and the Father are one.

However, In various verses Quran blames Christians for their beliefs about Jesus Christ. You can use [quran.com](https://quran.com) and search for "Jesus", "Christ" or "Messiah". As an example there is one verse from [Quran 5:72](https://quran.com/5/72) which tells those who believe Jesus is God has certainly fall into disbelief:

> Those who say, “Allah is the Messiah, son of Mary,” have certainly fallen into disbelief. The Messiah said, “O Children of Israel! Worship Allah—my Lord and your Lord.” Whoever associates others with Allah will surely be forbidden Paradise by Allah. Their home will be the Fire. And the wrongdoers will have no helpers.

(Note that "Allah" simply means "God, the one god" in Arabic. It doesn't have plural form and refers to exactly one. Christians who are Arab also use the same word to refer to God and followers of other Abrahamic religions as well.)

Also there is conversation between God and Jesus in which God promises Jesus that those
who followed him(=Jesus) will be elevated above those who didn't till the Judgement day:

> When Allah said, “O Jesus! I will take you and raise you up to Myself. I will deliver you from those who disbelieve, and elevate your followers above the disbelievers until the Day of Judgment. Then to Me you will all return, and I will settle all your disputes.

This verse is from [3:55](https://quran.com/3/55).

There are similarities between the attributes which Muslims believe God has and those which Christians, at least the majority of them, believe. Take this verse from [Quran 3:62](https://quran.com/3/62) and [Genesis 17:1](https://www.biblestudytools.com/genesis/17-1.html) as two examples:

> Certainly, this is the true narrative, and there is no god except Allah. And indeed, Allah is the Almighty, All-Wise. --Quran

> When Abram was ninety-nine years old, the LORD appeared to him and said, “I am God Almighty ; walk before me faithfully and be blameless. --Genesis

You can find in the end of a lot of verses attributes of God in Quran. I mention two other verses:

> He chooses whoever He wills to receive His mercy. And Allah is the Lord of infinite bounty.

In [3:74](https://quran.com/3/74)

> The Most Compassionate, taught the Quran, created humanity, taught them speech.

In [3:1-4](https://quran.com/55). The other alternative for "The Most Compassionate" is "The Most Merciful" which Quran mentions it as one the most important attributes of God.

As an example from the Bible, you can see this verse which says God/Allah created the heavens and the earth:

> In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.

In [Genesis 1:1](https://www.biblestudytools.com/genesis/1-1.html).

Also Quran speaks highly of Christians and that they are the closest to Muslims comparing to Jews or idol-worshippers of Mecca. For example [5:82](https://quran.com/5/82):

> You will surely find the most bitter towards the believers to be the Jews and polytheists and the most gracious to be those who call themselves Christian. That is because there are priests and monks among them and because they are not arrogant.

## Believing in all past Abrahamic religions

Christians believe in the prophets who Jews believe in as well as the Prophet John son of Zechariah who Mandaians follow. Christians believe in both Old Testament and New Testament. In one sentence, Christians believe in all Abrahamic religions before them.

So is true about Islam. Quran mentions Jesus, John, Elias, Abraham, Moses and many others as true prophets. Also Quran mentions Christians and Sabians(the other name for Mandaians) as those who are righteous and God believing and that God will reward them. This verse is from [2:62](https://quran.com/2/62)

> Indeed, the believers, Jews, Christians, and Sabians—whoever ˹truly˺ believes in Allah and the Last Day and does good will have their reward with their Lord. And there will be no fear for them, nor will they grieve.

However as Christians don't believe in Sabbath like Jews do, Muslims don't believe in many things earlier Abrahamic religions have, too. Christians go to church in the Sonday and it's their Sabbath. But unlike Jews, they don't believe all the day must be dedicated to God, meaning that doing anything else is a sin and forbidden. Similar to Jews and Christians, Muslims have a day in the week in which attending [the Friday prayer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friday_prayer) among other Muslims for any man who doesn't have an excuse is mandatory and ignoring it is a sin.

There is but a difference between Christianity and Islam from this aspect. According to [2:285](https://quran.com/2/285) believing in God, his Angels, his Scriptures(e.g. Gospels or Torah or Quran) and his Prophets is mandatory and principles of faith(plus one other not mentioned in this verse):

> The Messenger believes in what has been revealed to him from his Lord, and so do the believers. They believe in Allah, His angels, His Books, and His messengers. “We make no distinction between any of His messengers.” And they say, “We hear and obey. Your forgiveness, our Lord! And to You is the final return.”

But according to some verses, people corrupted the eariler Scriptures such as Torah.

> Do you expect them to be true to you, though a group of them would hear the word of Allah then knowingly corrupt it after understanding it?

From [2:75](https://quran.com/2/75)

> So woe to those who distort the Scripture with their own hands then say, “This is from Allah”—seeking a fleeting gain! So woe to them for what their hands have written, and woe to them for what they have earned. the Jews claim, “The Fire will not touch us except for a number of days.” Say, “Have you taken a pledge from Allah—for Allah never breaks His word—or are you saying about Allah what you do not know?” But no! Those who commit evil and are engrossed in sin will be the residents of the Fire. They will be there forever.

From [2:79-81](https://quran.com/2/79-81)

The verses above only targets Jews and Torah. But there are some about Christians and Gospel, too.

## Quran claim to be a miracle but Bible does not

That's a huge difference between Quran and Bible. Both claim to be the Word of One God who has created everything. But Quran claims to be miracle. But what does being a miracle mean? When God sends a prophet to people, he sends with the prophet a sign or signs that the person is a prophet. For example, God does something through the person which is only doable by God and not anyone else. So that people could realize that the person who claims to be a prophet, is really a true prophet.

As for Moses, he did something something similar to magicians but what moses did was something magicians could not do. As for Jesus Christ, he did many things including bringing a dead man back to life. As for Muhammad, he did several of such these which are narrated by his followers. For example sometimes the food was "blessed" and could feed more people for that amount of food. Which is highly irregular. But all those signs are for people of the 21st century, are just narrates.

People in today's world don't know if these narrates are real, human-made lies or some sort of delusions. So Quran claims to not be only word of God, but also something which no one could produce something like it. There are several verses in Quran about this. For example [17:88](https://quran.com/17/88) says that if all the humankind and the jinns(the demons) try to produce something like Quran, they would never achieve their goal:

> Say, “If humans and jinn were to come together to produce the equivalent of this Quran, they could not produce its equal, no matter how they supported each other.”

Actually the text of Quran was quite unnatural for the Arabs living at the same time as Muhammad, too. They were accusing him of being just a poet and that Quran is just poem. Some were preventing their families from listening to Quran because they were afraid they will become misguided like the followers of Muhammad. And finally, some were accusing Muhammad but being possessed that Quran is work of a supernatural being, demon or more precisely [Jinn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jinn).
