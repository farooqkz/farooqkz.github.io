Sometimes I think of myself, and my faith. Sometimes I feel like I am the true servant of my Lord, God. But sometimes I feel like I am more like a true follower of Satan and God's not my true Lord and that's just the lies I tell to myself.

Indeed, my Lord has given so much to me and made me his servant. I have friends who I am proud to be their friends and I have abilities in Computer Science, Mathematics and Programming which people rarely have. I also have a pretty good family, almost.

My Lord has given such these to me, what people rarely have; At least not together. But I have been ungrateful so far. It is obvious that my Lord does not need anything from me. He only wants one single thing: Make good use of them.

What does good use mean here? I assume it means some use which benefits the other people. A good use means a usage of the abilities which helps other people live their life better.

And that is what I am not doing; at least not always. Thus God is not pleased with me much and so do myself. I am pleased with myself whenever God is pleased with me as his servant and I believe God is pleased with me whenever I make a good use of what I have, or more exactly what God has given to me in this world.

One thing which annoys me, perhaps not a lot because I'm not a true believer, is that I don't pray the prayer; Or at least not regularly. I am not sure what can I do about it. Perhaps being with friends who do this helps me have this done, too. And actually it has: I recently got a new Muslim friend who prays the prayer and generally is a good boy. But that's not enough. And finding Muslim people around myself who I can be friend with them is not an easy task.

Where I live, good Muslim people are rare. They are like gems and hard to find and that's why I have got just one Muslim friend and not more.

This is a note for myself, I will never publish it; at least not in near future.

God may help us all. Amen!
