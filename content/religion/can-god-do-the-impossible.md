Abrahamic religions often believe that the deity in the religion can do absolutely anything. In other words, from the point of view of these religions, the deity, better known as God, is omnipotence. This then raises the omnipotence paradox. Here I assume the reader already knows this paradox. And other historical resolutions for this paradox. Thus I only get to the main thing, my resolution of this paradox.

## The proposed resolution

To discuss this paradox from logical point of view, I rewrite it here as a reference. We have a statement:

> God can create a stone which he cannot lift it.

People often assume that the abovewritten statement can be either True or False. And both cases lead to paradox. I would say perhaps the problem is with the [boolean and binary valued logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_algebra) which we use. As we can see in Computer Science and Mathematics, the logic needn't to be always binary. And paradox exists because we use a binary logic. Now if we use a [Ternary logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-valued_logic) which is a superset of binary logic but with a third value of "Unknown" or "Undecidable", we could resolve the paradox. The above statement would have a third truth value. And it does not resolve to paradox, in a ternary valued logic.

Such these paradoxes don't only happen with relation to super natural beings. See [Liar's paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liar_paradox).

## Motivation

The main motivation behind this resolution is that we see and overcome the limit of the logic we use. In Computer Science and Mathematical logic, we have problems which an algorithm can solve, and problems which an algorithm can never solve which they name it [undecidable problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undecidable_problem).

The point is that computers cannot solve an undecidable problem. Unless humans invent a new kind of computer which has different principles. But some of these undecidable problems, notably the [Halt problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem), can easily be solved by humans. We, humans, use the language and on the top of it logic to think about things and understand the world. But it also comes with some limitations. If we put the conventional logic aside and adopt a new one, we could solve some logical paradoxes, including the omnipotence paradox.
