This post is for those who are interested in Islam and Quran and is about the first chapter of the Book. It would be most interesting for followers of other Abrahamic religions like Christians but would be interesting for the others as well.

Quran is divided into Surahs. For now, you can consider it to be like Chapters in the Holy Bible but once you see surahs of Quran, you'll notice they are a lot different than Chapters in the Bible.

Each Surah in Quran has a name and many verses. This post is about the first Surah in Quran which is "AlFatiha" which when you tranlate it to English, it would be "The Opener".

The first verse of "The Opener" is "In the name of God, the Rahman, the Rahim".

"Rahman" and "Rahim" are two Arabic words with close meanings. Many different translations are offered. The most simple one is "The most merciful"

So translation of the first verse in "The Opener" and also almost every other Surah(or chapter) in Quran is as follows:

> In the name of God, the most Merciful.

Some facts:

- There is a Surah near the end of Quran which its name is "Rahman".

Now let's move to the second verse: "The praise is to(or is for) God the Lord of the Worlds".
