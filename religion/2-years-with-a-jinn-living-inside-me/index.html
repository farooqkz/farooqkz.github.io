Oh Jinn? What is that? I think the best English translation for this Arabic word is “Demon”. But I am gonna use the Arabic word to make sure I refer to the one described in Islam. You might find it surprising that someone believes in something like this, which seems to be some legend from former ignorant people.
As a fact, proving or disproving existence of such a thing is impossible. But as Russell argued in the 20th century, this does not allow us to believe in anything which its existence is impossible to disprove."><meta property="og:locale" content="en_us"><meta property="og:type" content="article"><meta property="article:section" content="religion"><meta property="article:published_time" content="2022-01-17T12:28:08+03:30"><meta property="article:modified_time" content="2022-01-17T12:28:08+03:30"><meta name=twitter:card content="summary"><meta name=twitter:title content="2 years with a Jinn living inside me"><meta name=twitter:description content="Updated on 2023-07-16

But as <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertrand_Russell target=_blank>Russell</a> argued in the 20th century, this does not allow us to believe in anything which its existence is impossible to disprove.</p><p>However, this belief of me in Islam, make me get myself out of trouble. During the summer before 12nd grade, I was studying hard for Conquer, a big exam in Iran in which people go university through it, and everything was fine before something terrible happen to me: Suddenly and at once he was not able to study and code and sometimes not even plain reading.</p><p>Also some other weird stuff happened to me at the same time. I had lost many functionallities of my body. The worst part was that I could not use my hand and fingers for typing, which is necessary for programming and writing which is necessary for mathematics.</p><p>I messed school exams up and the more important exam which was Conquer as well. After about two years, I learned about healing through Quran and praying. I also learned about “Sihr”(Black magic) and “Hasad”(Envy). There are different kinds of Sihr and one of them is a Sihr which could ruin success of a successful person(for example a successful student) and turn them into someone with a lot of faults and no success. Hasad could have such an effect, too.</p><p>I got a recipe from someone and listened to Quran reciting voice everyday. In the beginning listening to Quran was hard for me like a burden. Additionally, listening to Quran was making me angry wanting to break stuff or throw stuff away. I could listen to Quran without having any problem before this period. I was told, when I listen Quran, the Jinn who has possessed me gets pressured and so he/she pressures me to make me stop listening and I had to do the opposite.</p><p>I listened to Quran till I got my ability for mind tasks like coding and math back. After this, I am highly confident if I ever disbelieve in Islam and in God.</p><p>Thanks to God, then three people who gave me consults.</p><script type=text/javascript src=/cactus.js></script><link rel=stylesheet href=/style.css type=text/css><div id=comment-section></div><script>window.onload=()=>initComments({node:document.getElementById("comment-section"),defaultHomeserverUrl:"https://matrix.cactus.chat:8448",serverName:"cactus.chat",siteName:"far.chickenkiller.com",commentSectionId:"2-years-with-a-jinn-living-inside-me.md"})</script></div><div class=tags dir=auto><div class=taxosfloating_left><p>Categories</p></div><div class=termsfloating_right><p><a href=/categories/religion/>religion</a></p></div><div class=clearit></div></div></article></div></main><footer>(C) Some rights are reserved under CC-BY-SA 4.0 for Farooq Karimi Zadeh</footer><script src=/js/dark-mode.js></script></body></html>
