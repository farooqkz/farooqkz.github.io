We were four in a Circle and each had to say a name in a turn based basis. It was no surprise that the author had won the game having the most years of experience with Python; from 2015.</p><p>The next game was a version of old hangman game except that a Python builtin callable was chosen. None of us could guess the word of one another and after that the time was over.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve been thinking of a web based version of the first game but it would have no point or fun since anyone participating in the game with a tab of their favourite browser could open another tab and search for whatever module in PyPI.</p><p>These games and similar games about programming or computer science stuff could be played in other sessions too.</p></div></div></article></div></main><footer>(C) All rights are reserved under CC-BY-SA 4.0 for Farooq Karimi Zadeh</footer><script src=/js/dark-mode.js></script></body></html>
