The game was about saying a Python module which is either builtin or at least familiar to all the members. We were four in a Circle and each had to say a name in a turn based basis. It was no surprise that the author had won the game having the most years of experience with Python; from 2015."><meta property="og:locale" content="en_us"><meta property="og:type" content="article"><meta property="article:section" content="computer"><meta property="article:published_time" content="2022-02-22T17:45:29+03:30"><meta property="article:modified_time" content="2022-02-22T17:45:29+03:30"><meta name=twitter:card content="summary"><meta name=twitter:title content="Second Session of Hormozgan Free Software Group"><meta name=twitter:description content="Yesterday, I was in the 2nd session of Hormozgan Free Software Group for people in Bandar Abbas, Hormozgan, Iran.
