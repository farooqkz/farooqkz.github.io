Historically, NNs were abandoned after a not so long period of enthusiasm and several interesting researches. But after sometime, perhaps after computers were more capable, they returned back to the game. Nowadays, a lot of people who are in touch with technology stuff probably imagine Machine Learning means Neural Networks.</p><h2 id=what-are-anns>What are ANNs?</h2><p>To answer this question, we first need to understand what a &ldquo;neuron&rdquo; is and only after that, we can understand the whole concept which is a network formed by these small units. Mathematically speaking, a neuron is a math function which takes a vector of reals, computes each of them with another real named &ldquo;weight&rdquo; and will output 1 only if the sum of these multiplications is greater than a threshold:</p><p>$ f(X) = \begin{cases}
b + \sum_{i=1}^{n}{X_i} \gt 0 \rarr 1 \
&\text{o/w} 0
\end{cases}$</p><p>If you don&rsquo;t like math, a neuron is simply a machine which takes many numbers, multiplies each of them with another number and only if the sum plus a &ldquo;bias&rdquo; or $b$ is greater than a threshold, the machine will turn on and output $1$. Otherwise, the machine will stay off and won&rsquo;t output anything. Strictly speaking, each of these machines uses an &ldquo;Activation Function&rdquo; and <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Step_function target=_blank>the step function</a> is just one of the choices we have for our neuron.</p><p>Now an ANN, is more than one of these &ldquo;machines&rdquo;. The first neuron gets fed from our input and sends its output to the next neuron. Then the next neuron does the same job but with probably different &ldquo;weights&rdquo; and will give its output to the next till we reach the &ldquo;output&rdquo; neuron which we get our output from. In actual implementations, usually we have several layers of these neurons. With each layer getting its input from the previous layer and feeding its output to the next one(Except, obviously, the input and output layers).</p><p><figure><img src=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/00/Multi-Layer_Neural_Network-Vector-Blank.svg alt="A two layer NN"></figure></p><p>This picture is from the WikiMedia user <a href=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Multi-Layer_Neural_Network-Vector-Blank.svg target=_blank>Offnfopt</a></p><p>Now, if we choose the weights of each neuron correctly, we can get our network to do a certain task for us. For example we want our network to distinguish input photos, dog or cat. This is a binary classification problem in Machine Learning which NNs can solve for us if we happen to find the right weights and structure for our network.</p><p>The process of finding these &ldquo;weights&rdquo; or possibly even the structure itself, is called &ldquo;training&rdquo;. In ML, in general, the process of finding the optimum model and/or parameters which suits our problem is called that. In the case of an NN, the model is the structure and the weights used in the network.</p><h2 id=what-is-the-problem-of-anns>What is the problem of ANNs?</h2><p>TL;DR, &ldquo;Performance&rdquo;.</p><p>The idea is very interesting and it is amazing that this computation machine is Turing Complete. In plain English, Turing Completeness of a computation machine or model means that you can solve any problem with it. Nevertheless, if we get too technical, there are problems which are proved to be <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undecidable_problem target=_blank>unsolvable by an Algorithm</a></p><p>But these interesting machines, are very inefficient the way we get them to work. Most of the time, we &ldquo;simulate&rdquo; the NNs on our computers both for training and usage. When we try to simulate stuff on something which it wasn&rsquo;t meant for it, we sacrifice performance and NNs are no exception. The processors we use are meant to have a list of instructions and execute them one by one(let&rsquo;s forget about fancier stuff like multi-processing for now).</p><p>There have been several tries to implement NNs as actual hardware. But these are not widespread, yet.</p><h2 id=what-other-paradigm-of-ml-exist>What other paradigm of ML exist?</h2><p>Several, actually. I have decided to concentrate my research and studies on one of them: Evolutionary Machine Learning and <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_programming target=_blank>Genetic Programming</a>. In GP, we see the code as data and as our model to solve a problem. I believe the idea was first formulated by <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Koza target=_blank>John Koza</a> in his book. In plain, the idea is that we need to find a program which does the job we have in mind.</p><p><em>NOTE: To be strict, there were many who proposed evolving programs to solve problems earlier than Koza did. One of whom is the famous Turing, the Father of Computer Science. However, to my knowledge, it was Koza who first employed this technique to solve ML problems with it.</em></p><p>Let&rsquo;s talk about the binary classification problem, again. Is the given photo, a photo of a dog or a cat? With ANNs, we have to simulate them on a computer to train them using whatever learning method. And these days, you need to employ GPUs most of the time if you want to do something non-trivial. After the training, your model is a network structure and a set of weights and you have to simulate the model on the target machine.</p><p>But with GP, our model is an actual computer program. We need to find a program which does our job well enough. And to get to the right program, we use methods of <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_selection target=_blank>Natural Selection</a> and &ldquo;survival of the fittests&rdquo;</p><p>There are several ways to represent these &ldquo;programs&rdquo;. Initially, Koza used <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_%28programming_language%29 target=_blank>Lisp</a> to accomplish the goal. The feature Lisp had at that time which I believe no other language had, was that the Lisp code could also be seen as and behaved with like some data. Koza used Lisp <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-expression target=_blank>S-expressions</a> to represent programs. And he wrote programs, which were producing programs(or Lisp S-expressions), to solve different tasks like evolving a multiplexer.</p><p>The representation J. Koza chose is today known as &ldquo;Tree Genetic Programming&rdquo;. After that, several other representations were proposed by researchers which each are better suited for a specific class of tasks. For example, Genetic Network Programming was proposed to solve the Artifical Ant problem more efficient than the representation Koza had used for the same problem. In this problem, we need to program a machine, an artificial ant, which is looking for food in an area. The location of food blocks is unknown but we have several of these &ldquo;ants&rdquo; and each ant can mark an area to guide other ants once it found the food blocks. The goal is finding a strategy(or a program) for all ants which maximizes the amount of food found in a constant period of time.</p><p>Another representation is Stack based Genetic Programming. I have written a simple program to solve a Symbolic Regression problem which is available on <a href=https://github.com/farooqkz/stack-gp-test target=_blank>a Github repository</a>. I&rsquo;ve included some small introduction about Stack GP and the problem my codes solves with it, as well.</p><p>Finally, if you are interesting to learn more about Genetic Programming, I suggest you read <a href=https://alfagroup.csail.mit.edu/sites/default/files/documents/2015%20Genetic%20Programming.%20James%20McDermott%20and%20Una-May%20O%27Reilly.%20Handbook%20of%20Computational%20Intelligence%2C%202015.pdf target=_blank>this introduction</a>.</p><script type=text/javascript src=https://latest.cactus.chat/cactus.js></script><link rel=stylesheet href=https://latest.cactus.chat/style.css type=text/css><div id=comment-section></div><script>window.onload=()=>initComments({node:document.getElementById("comment-section"),defaultHomeserverUrl:"https://matrix.cactus.chat:8448",serverName:"cactus.chat",siteName:"far.chickenkiller.com",commentSectionId:"machine-learning-is-not-neural-network.md"})</script></div></div></article></div></main><footer>(C) Some rights are reserved under CC-BY-SA 4.0 for Farooq Karimi Zadeh</footer><script src=/js/dark-mode.js></script></body></html>
